/**
 * Which commands does the exercise under the learner's cursor reach for?
 *
 * The cheat sheet's focus filter reads this. The scroll-spy anchor of every
 * inline activity IS its scenario id (LessonActivity passes the same string
 * to both props), and a challenge's anchor IS its challenge id — so one
 * lookup against both registries resolves "where the learner is" into an
 * exercise. Playgrounds contribute their `suggestedCommands` walkthrough;
 * challenges contribute the whole kit, distractors included — the cheat
 * sheet explains what each command does, which is exactly the audit a salted
 * pool invites, and it never reveals which pool entries are the solution.
