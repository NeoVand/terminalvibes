	/* ══ ONE OBJECT, TWO WIDTHS ═══════════════════════════════════════════════

	   This sidebar used to be two components sharing a file: a `.sidebar-expanded`
	   drawer under `{#if open}` and a `.sidebar-collapsed` icon rail under
	   `{#if !open}`. Toggling destroyed every node in one and constructed a
	   different set in the other, so there was nothing for the browser to animate
	   BETWEEN — the rail's icons vanished, then a panel slid in from off-screen
	   carrying new icons that merely resembled them. No amount of transition
	   tuning reaches that, because the elements are not the same elements.

	   There is now ONE tree, always mounted. Collapsed and expanded are the same
	   nav at two container widths:

	     - the panel's WIDTH animates, 52px ⇄ 280px, and nothing translates;
	     - `.rail-inner` is laid out at the FULL 280px at all times and the panel
	       clips it, so no row ever reflows horizontally — the collapsed state is
	       literally the expanded state with 228px of it cropped off;
	     - labels and carets fade and then go `visibility: hidden`, which is what
	       keeps them out of the tab order and the accessibility tree while they
	       are invisible;
	     - a part's children are a `grid-template-rows: 0fr → 1fr` reveal on
	       persistent nodes rather than a mount, so they grow in the same gesture
	       whether it was the part or the whole sidebar that opened.

	   The consequence that matters: the icon column's x is 5.5px (nav) + 12px
	   (row) + 8.5px (half a 17px glyph) = 26px, computed from paddings that do
	   not depend on the panel's width. It is 26.00px collapsed, 26.00px expanded,
	   and 26.00px on every frame in between — by construction, not by tuning. 26
	   is the app logo's centre in the header, so the whole left edge of the app
	   is one column. */

	/**
	 * One clock for the entire morph: the panel's width, the labels fading up,
	 * the icons brightening, the carets turning, the children sliding down and
	 * the thread lighting. They are not separate animations that happen to be
	 * near each other, they are one gesture, and the moment two of them disagree
	 * it reads as a swap again.
	 *
	 * 200ms is not a taste value — it is `duration-200` on `.main-content`'s
	 * margin in +page.svelte and on the `.sidebar-panel` width here. The page
	 * body and the sidebar edge are the same moving line, so they must be on the
	 * same clock or the reader sees the panel arrive and the text follow.
	 *
	 * Exposed to CSS as `--morph-ms` on the panel, so the stylesheet cannot fall
	 * out of step with the script, and so `prefers-reduced-motion` can collapse

	   Collapsed, the rail is fifteen unlabelled glyphs. The icon answers "take
	   me there"; nothing answered "what is in here?" without committing to the
	   drawer. This restores that answer.

	   It is not the old flyout brought back. The old one was a second,
	   INTERACTIVE copy of the nav — its own header button, its own child
	   buttons, its own full-screen scrim — opened on CLICK. In the merged tree
	   that is precisely the thing the rewrite exists to forbid: the inline
	   labels and child rows are always in the DOM now, so an interactive flyout
	   would be a second reachable rendering of rows that are, three metres away
	   in the same tree, deliberately `visibility: hidden` to keep them OUT of
	   the tab order. Two labelled copies of one list, one of them hidden from AT
	   and one not, is worse than no preview at all.

	   So this one is a READING SURFACE and nothing else:

	     - it holds no focusable node — not a button, not a link, not a
	       [tabindex]. There is no second tab stop and no focus to trap;
	     - it is `aria-hidden`, because the accessible tree already has this
	       information: `.nav-part` carries `aria-label={section.label}`, and a
	       screen-reader user opens the part rather than hovering a picture of
	       it. Exposing it twice would make the same fifteen parts announce
	       thirty times;
	     - it lives OUTSIDE the `<aside>`. The panel is `overflow: hidden` (that
	       clip is what crops the 280px rail to 52px), so anything inside it
	       would be cut off at the icon column. Being a fixed-position sibling
	       also means it cannot reflow the nav, cannot shift the icon column off
	       26px, and cannot put a scrollbar anywhere near it.

	   VERBS: hover/focus previews, click commits. The flyout never navigates,

	   not the mini timeline wearing a disguise: it is one dim hairline through
	   the glyphs, carries no state, and measures nothing.

	   It BREAKS at every icon. Drawing it straight through looked dirty:
	   these are outlined, open glyphs, so a line crossing one shows through
	   its interior and collides with its strokes. Stopping short either side
	   lets the icon sit in the thread the way a bead sits on a string.

	   It is deliberately NOT one element. Each row draws the two pieces that
	   cross it and each open part's rule draws its own, so the thread is
	   produced by layout instead of measured against it: nothing to
	   recompute on resize, on expand, or per frame while a part animates
