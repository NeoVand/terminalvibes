	   How long the reader actually spent at each place in the document, painted
	   as a cold->warm gradient inside each bar. The tracker owns the numbers and
	   the storage (see dwell.ts); the rail only ever paints what it publishes.

	   THE SEAM, and it is an absolute rule again: paint() never touches
	   `background-image`, the heat subscription never touches geometry. That
	   keeps a synchronous pointer path which already writes ~200 inline styles
	   from also rebuilding 57 gradient strings a frame.

	   A previous pass relaxed it, on the theory that percentage stops fall out
	   of register with the document under the lens — the Gaussian is centred on
	   the cursor, so a magnified bar is stretched harder at the end facing the
	   centre than at the far end, while the gradient stretches uniformly. The
	   theory is right and the magnitude is not. Measured against the real
	   mapping across 201 lens positions x 57 bars x 16 buckets, the worst
	   intra-bar residual is 0.99px at A = 3.2 and 0.16px at rest — about one
	   device pixel, at the single worst bucket of the single worst bar. It is
	   not perceptible, and correcting it costs a per-frame string rebuild.

	   What IS perceptible is the correction in motion: lens-corrected stops
	   move every time the pointer does, so the gradient churns inside a bar
	   that is otherwise just growing. That shipped once and came back as "the
	   heat distribution dances around inside each of the boxes". See the header
	   of heat.ts, which owns this decision.

	   So the stops are percentages, the browser rescales them with the element
	   for free, and the heat is welded to its bar: verified in the browser by
	   magnifying a warm bar 1.21x and diffing the gradient string, which is
	   byte-identical before and after. Do not reintroduce lens correction here
	   without re-measuring that residual first. */

	/* Lane geometry. The challenge lane is now a MIRROR of the playground lane
	   about the thread's centre line, and both are driven by the same
	   `laneMark(k)` — see mapping.ts. Two owner reports are the reason:

	     "the playground markers are kind of closer to the timeline than the
	      challenges" — they were. The playgrounds rode a stem that shortened
	      with magnification while the challenges hung off a fixed centre, so
	      the gap below the thread was both larger and differently-behaved.

	     "under the magnifier the challenges don't change their Y position" —
	      they did not. `size` was mag-derived but the CENTRE was the constant
	      39.5, so a challenge swelled in place while its neighbour above lifted.

	   Both fall out of one rule: the diamond's top VERTEX sits at
	   `2 * CY - base`, exactly as far below the thread as the square's top edge
	   sits above it, and the stem is the same `stemH` either way.

	   The old CH_CENTRE = 39.5 was pinned to stop a magnified rhomboid walking
	   off the bottom of a 48px header. That correctness survives for free and
	   is now a consequence rather than a constant: at full magnification the
	   mirror puts the top vertex at 34 and the half-diagonal at 5.5, so the
	   centre lands on 39.5 and the lowest vertex on 45 — three pixels clear of
	   the rail, with no clamp needed. Below full magnification the mark rises
	   toward the thread, which is the behaviour that was missing.

	   SIZE. `laneMark` hands back the square's EDGE, and a square rotated 45°
	   measures edge * √2 across — so feeding the same number to both lanes
	   would make the diamond 41% wider than its neighbour AND break the mirror
	   (at k = 1 it would reach y 49.6, off a 48px rail).

	   CH_RATIO is therefore the diamond's edge as a fraction of the square's.
	   0.80 is not a fresh judgement: it is the constant the previous tuning
	   already implied at full magnification, where CH_MAX 9.5 against pgMax 11
	   is a ratio of 0.86 — trimmed to 0.80 so the mirrored shape clears the
	   bottom of a 48px header (lowest vertex 46.4 at k = 1, against 47.2 at
	   0.86). It leaves the diamond measuring 1.13x the square across, i.e.
	   noticeably wider but 64% of its area, which is what it takes for a
	   rotated outline to carry the same weight as an upright filled one. The
	   old code reached the same place with a max; expressing it as a RATIO is
	   what makes the two lanes grow at the same rate instead of only agreeing
	   at one end.

	   CH_MIN is the one number still not derived. At rest `size` is 4.5, so the
	   ratio alone gives a 3.6px edge, and the note this constant replaces
	   recorded that a 4.5px edge with a 1px border leaves ~2.5px of interior —
	   which is what "the challenges are invisible" meant. 5.2 holds the floor
	   there, and it binds only below k = 0.21: over four fifths of the lens
	   range, including everything the reader has actually magnified, the size
	   is the ratio.

	   All of it lives in `challengeMark` next to `laneMark` rather than here,
	   so the mirror is one function of `k` that a test can hold against the
	   lane it reflects. See mapping.test.ts. */

	   ease-in-out deliberately spends its first frames nearly still. Entering
	   the rail and sweeping immediately left the lens a measured 92px behind
	   the hand.

	   Deleting the glide is not the fix — it exists because the lens has to
	   travel from wherever it was resting to the cursor, and snapping that
	   distance is the jump the whole design fought to remove. Two changes
	   instead:

	     1. The duration is PROPORTIONAL TO THE DISTANCE it has to cover.
	        Entering next to the resting lens is instant (below `SNAP_MS` it
	        does not animate at all); entering from the far end still glides.
	     2. It is a critically damped SPRING rather than a fixed-duration ease,
	        so it is always converging on the LIVE pointer instead of counting
	        down a clock. A spring has no notion of "not finished yet", so
	        there is no window in which the pointer is ignored — and because it
	        is critically damped it cannot overshoot, which is what would turn
	        a fast entry into a wobble.

	   The integrator is the closed-form solution of the critically damped
	   oscillator over one step, NOT Euler. Euler on a stiff spring (short

		   31.68px is 7 periods of the 45° hatch along each axis (3.2px along the

	/* Rhomboids, and the reason they are NOT drawn with `border`.
	   "the border of the rhomboids for challenges is thicker than the border of
	   the squares" — they were both literally `border: 1px`, and the rhomboid
	   still read heavier, because a square rotated 45° meets the pixel grid
	   diagonally. Its stroke cannot land on a pixel row, so the rasteriser
	   spreads it across two, and a band of half-lit pixels twice as wide reads
	   as a fatter pen even though the total ink is identical.

	   Measured (8 sub-pixel phases, coverage profile along the edge normal,
	   equivalent width = ink / peak):

	     DPR 1, 9.5px square vs 7.6px rhomboid, both 1px
	       square    ink 1.000  peak 0.999  equivWidth 1.001
	       rhomboid  ink 0.893  peak 0.686  equivWidth 1.301   <- 1.30x
	     DPR 2, same pair, both 1px
	       square    ink 1.000  peak 1.000  equivWidth 1.000
	       rhomboid  ink 0.952  peak 0.940  equivWidth 1.013   <- already level

	   So the defect is a DPR 1 artefact and DPR 2 needs no correction at all —
	   which is why the fix is behind a resolution query rather than applied flat.

	   `border-width` cannot express the correction: Chrome quantises it to whole
	   CSS pixels. Measured on a 40px box, border-width 0.25 / 0.5 / 0.75 / 1 /
	   1.5px ALL render exactly 156 css-px^2 of ink (= 4 x 39 x 1), and only 2px
	   moves, to 304. That holds at DPR 2 as well. `outline` is quantised too
	   (164 at every width). An inset box-shadow is the one stroke that is
	   genuinely sub-pixel — its ink scales with the spread at both DPRs — so the
	   rhomboid's outline is drawn with one.

	   0.75px is where the diagonal band bottoms out: it takes equivWidth from
	   1.301 to 1.165, and no thinner value goes lower (0.70 -> 1.169, 0.60 ->
	   1.178, 0.45 -> 1.278, as ink collapses faster than extent). The residual
	   1.165 vs 1.001 is the irreducible cost of a diagonal on a 1x grid. */

	   A glowing cyan point per matching anchor, sitting on the thread itself:
	   the rail's whole claim is that a document position is a place on this
	   line, so "your search is HERE" has to be stated in that same language
	   rather than in a separate lane.

	   Bright at rest, deliberately. Everything else on the rail is subtle until
	   you reach for it, because everything else is ambient. A search hit is the
	   opposite: it exists for a few seconds, in direct response to something
	   the reader just typed, and the moment it matters most is the moment
	   before the pointer arrives. So it carries its own light instead of
	   waiting for the lens.

	   Sized in absolute pixels rather than from `mag`, for the same reason —
	   a hit out in the compressed tail is exactly the one worth finding, and
	   scaling it with the lens would hide it until you had already found it. */
