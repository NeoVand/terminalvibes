/**
 * The one channel between the header's search box and the Thread rail.
 *
 * `SearchEntry.sectionId` is already a DOM anchor id, and every rail mark is
 * keyed by the same anchor id, so a result set maps straight onto rail
 * positions with no translation table. What it must NOT do is travel by prop:
 * Search and ThreadRail are siblings under Header, which is itself a child of
 * the page, so threading a result set between them would mean two new props on
 * Header and one on the page — three files edited to move a value that only
 * two components care about, and a re-render of the whole header on every
 * keystroke.
 *
 * A module-level rune is the smaller thing. It is a singleton, which is
 * correct here: there is exactly one search box and exactly one rail.
 *
 * Search is the only writer; the rail is a reader.
