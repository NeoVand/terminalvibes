/**
 * Per-part progress rollup, shared by the header rail and the sidebar.
 *
 * This module exists because the two surfaces used to disagree. The sidebar
 * divided its "% read" by `sectionIds.length` — 71 entries, which is 15 PART
 * HEADERS plus 56 sections, and excludes all 35 playgrounds and the
 * `prompt-designer` tool anchor. The rail's HUD counts only `kind: 'section'`
 * items (57 of them) and reports playgrounds separately as "n/m solved". Two
 * different denominators for the same word on the same screen reads as a bug.
 *
 * The fix is to make the MANIFEST the single source of both numbers, so the
 * sidebar's percentage is by construction the sum of the rail's per-part
 * "n/m read" chips over every part. Part headers are excluded from the read
 * denominator deliberately: a part header is a title, not content, and the
 * reader cannot "read" it independently of the section under it. Playgrounds
 * are excluded too, because they already have their own denominator — counting
 * one both as read and as an exercise double-counts the same work.
 *
 * Grouping is "the most recent `kind: 'part'` at or before this item in
 * manifest order", which is exactly what `buildModel`'s `partOf` map does for
 * non-part items. So the per-part splits here and the rail's HUD splits are the
 * same partition, not two implementations that happen to agree today.
