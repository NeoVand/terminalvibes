/**
 * Dwell tracking: how long the reader actually spent at each place in the
 * document, turned into a per-bar heat gradient on the Thread rail.
 *
 * This replaces "did you scroll past it" with "did you stay". The old binary
 * signal marked all 57 sections read on one flick to the bottom; the measure
 * here cannot be faked that way, because a fling deposits time proportional to
 * how long the fling took, which is nothing.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHERE THE NUMBERS COME FROM, AND THE ONE PLACE TWO SPECS DISAGREED
 *
 * Two design passes produced parameters for this. They are reconciled here, and
 * the reconciliation is not an average — averaging two calibrations produces a
 * third that neither pass validated.
 *
 *  - GRANULARITY: 16 buckets per bar, spanning that bar's own document extent.
 *    Section-relative, never pixel-absolute. A browser resize, a web font
 *    landing, a Mermaid diagram mounting mid-scroll and a new part being added
 *    all move every absolute offset in the document; under a global pixel grid
 *    each of those is data loss, and the first three happen routinely. Under
 *    section-relative buckets none of them touches a stored byte — the geometry
 *    table is rebuilt and the same bucket indices simply point at new pixels.
 *
 *  - EXPECTED TIME: `dwell-calibration.json`, the per-anchor dataset, rather
 *    than word count alone. Prose is only a fifth of this page; the rest is
 *    figures, code blocks and playgrounds. A word-count model demands near-zero
 *    dwell exactly where a learner lingers longest, which is the current bug
 *    wearing a new hat.
 *
 *  - CONCAVITY: ONE PER AXIS, and the two axes now each hold theirs in the
 *    obvious place. On time -> heat it is `heatGamma`. On heat -> colour it is
 *    nothing at all: `chromaGamma` is 1 and the ramp is linear.
 *
 *    This is a REVERSAL of the original choice, and the reversal is the fix.
 *
 *    The two competing specs both proposed a concavity on the time axis —
 *    "saturate at 70% of modelled time" and `heat = (dwell/expected)^0.7` — and
 *    the first was picked because it is the more sayable sentence. But they are
 *    not interchangeable, and the difference is precisely the complaint this
 *    file exists to answer. A saturation fraction is a CLIP POINT: it scales the
 *    ratio uniformly and then flattens the top. It cannot change the SHAPE near
 *    zero, and the shape near zero is the entire problem — "a skim leaves
 *    nothing, and then it goes dark" is a description of a curve that is too
 *    straight at the bottom and clipped at the top, which is exactly what a clip
 *    point gives you.
 *
 *    So the roles swap. `saturateAt` goes to 1.0 — the deliberately-disabled
 *    knob, meaning only "a full read is the modelled time, no more, no less" —
 *    and `heatGamma` carries the concavity. See its note for the shipped table.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE DEAD ZONE HAD TWO HALVES, AND THE CURVE WAS THE SMALLER ONE
 *
 * Measured on the production build, fresh profile, 1440x900, wheel-scrolled at
 * a real wall clock, reading back the tracker's own stored seconds:
 *
 *     skim @  700 px/s   276s of scrolling   57/57 bars touched, median 4.4s
 *     skim @ 1500 px/s   158s of scrolling    5/57 bars touched, median 0.25s
 *
 * The second row is the owner's "just casually skimming through". Two and a half
 * minutes of continuous scrolling deposited SIX SECONDS total and left 52 bars
 * at literally zero — not a faint mark, no mark. That is not the curve being
 * shy; that is `maxVelocityPxPerSec` being a cliff at 900 and rejecting the
 * whole traverse. A cliff cannot be softened by tuning what is on the far side
 * of it, which is why previous passes at the curve alone did not land.
 *
 * So the gate becomes a RAMP rather than a wall (`readingVelocityPxPerSec` ->
 * `maxVelocityPxPerSec`), and the curve becomes concave. The first change
 * removes the hard edge; the second makes the seconds that survive it visible.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * ALL TUNING LIVES IN `DWELL`. Nothing else in this file holds a magic number.

	 *
	 *  - 2200 px/s is a viewport every 0.39s. Nobody takes anything in at that
	 *    rate, so it is the honest zero.
	 *
	 *  - the 1.5 exponent bends the ramp toward the slow end, so the credit lost
	 *    in the first slice above reading pace is small. At 1000px/s — brisk, but
	 *    a reader could still be tracking headings — credit is 0.68.
	 *
	 * THE FLING IS UNAFFECTED, and this is the invariant to check first if these
