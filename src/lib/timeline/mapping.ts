/**
 * The Thread rail's geometry — pure, framework-free, no DOM.
 *
 * Everything the rail does is a function of ONE number: `p`, the cursor's
 * position along the rail in [0,1]. A density over SCREEN space dips at the
 * cursor and relaxes to 1 far away,
 *
 *     w(t) = 1 - (1 - 1/A) * exp(-((t - p) / sigma)^2)
 *
 * and screen -> document is its normalised integral:
 *
 *     u(s) = INT_0^s w  /  INT_0^1 w
 *
 * Because w is strictly positive everywhere (min w = 1/A > 0 for finite A),
 * u is continuous and STRICTLY INCREASING with u(0) = 0 and u(1) = 1.
 * Therefore sweeping the cursor left to right walks the document forward
 * through every anchor, in order, exactly once — nothing skipped, nothing
 * backwards, nothing unreachable. That property is the whole design, and
 * mapping.test.ts is where it is enforced.
 *
 * du/ds is smallest at the cursor, so the document is stretched there by A —
 * "magnification". Normalising by INT_0^1 w conserves screen width, so
 * magnifying near the cursor necessarily compresses the far field in exactly
 * the right proportion: the squish adapts to the zoom by construction rather
 * than by hand-tuning.
 *
 * DO NOT rewrite the numerics. The trapezoid table, the U[0]=0 / U[N]=1
 * pinning, the shared-table toDoc/toScreen pair and the 36-step bisection in
 * solveP are jointly what give monotonicity and a ~1e-16 round trip.
