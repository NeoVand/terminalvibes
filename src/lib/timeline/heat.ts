/**
 * The dwell heat ramp: a scalar in [0,1] -> a colour, and a run of scalars -> a
 * CSS gradient.
 *
 * The signal the ramp carries is SATURATION RISING. Both themes raise chroma
 * monotonically from cold to hot; they disagree only about lightness, because
 * on cream a lighter hot end would have less contrast than the cold end, not
 * more. So light goes darker-and-richer and dark goes lighter-and-richer, and
 * the thing they share — more colour means more time spent — is the part a
 * reader actually decodes.
 *
 * Interpolation is in OKLCh rather than sRGB. Between a dim brown and a
 * saturated gold, sRGB dips through a desaturated mud at the midpoint; polar
 * interpolation holds chroma across the whole ramp. Since the entire message is
 * "chroma increases", the colour space here is the mechanism, not a refinement.
 *
 * Resolved ONCE per theme into concrete `rgb()` strings. Painting 57 bars x 16
 * stops with `color-mix()` would be 912 colour resolutions inside a style
 * string; indexing a LUT is 16 array reads and a join.

 * rather than a ramp.
 *
 * Stops are ALWAYS evenly spaced percentages, and deliberately so.
 *
 * An earlier pass made them lens-corrected — each bucket placed at
 * `map.toScreen(bucketDocPosition)` so the heat stayed registered to the
 * document under the fisheye. That is defensible in principle and wrong in
 * practice: the corrected stops shift on every pointer move, so the gradient
 * visibly churns inside a bar that is otherwise just growing. A small static
 * distortion is imperceptible; the same distortion in motion is the most
 * salient thing on the rail. Reported as "the heat distribution dances around
 * inside each of the boxes".
 *
 * The bar is the unit. Its gradient is its identity: when the lens grows the
 * bar, the gradient should scale with it like a zoomed image and nothing
 * should slosh. Percentages give exactly that for free — the browser rescales
 * a percentage gradient with its element — so the correct implementation is
 * also the cheapest one, with no per-frame work at all.
 *
 * Bin COUNT is likewise fixed at every zoom level (see DWELL.bucketsPerSection):
 * resampling bins under magnification was the original defect.
