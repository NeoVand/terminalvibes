/**
 * Builds static/images/thumbs/<anchor-id>.webp — the hover-card banners for
 * the header's Thread rail.
 *
 * The section banners in static/images are 190 KB–647 KB each (25 MB across
 * 61 files). Serving one of those on hover is absurd for a 236 px card, and
 * the rail can fire several hovers a second. At 480×270 (2× the card at 16:9)
 * quality 62 the same images average ~15 KB — the whole set is ~1.2 MB, and a
 * hover costs about as much as a favicon.
 *
 * Keyed by ANCHOR ID rather than by source filename, so the card needs no
 * second lookup: it already knows the id it is drawing.
 *
 * Run with: npm run build:timeline  (commit the output — CI never rebuilds it.)
